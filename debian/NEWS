suitesparse (1:3.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Starting with this version, the libraries that were bundled together
    in the libsuitesparse-x.y.z package are now distributed in individual
    packages.  The new packages have names that follow the Debian
    conventions and correspond really to the library sonames.  For
    instance, the package libamd2.2 contains /usr/lib/libamd.so.2.2.

suitesparse (3.1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

    Since the upstream author does not provide soversion numbers for the
    individual libraries, they are arbitrarily set in this package to the
    version number of SuiteSparse itself.  This is the reason the library
    package has a versioned name now.
